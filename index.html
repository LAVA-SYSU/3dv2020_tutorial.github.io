        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2> Overview </h2>

        With the rapid development of point-cloud acquisition techniques (<I>e.g.</I>, Microsoft Kinect) and computing
        devices, 3D data (point clouds, depth images, meshes) processing has become a rapidly growing research area in
        computer vision, pattern recognition and computer graphics. Extensive investigations have been conducted on
        3D related topics, such as 3D modeling, 3D scene reconstruction/understanding,
        3D object recognition, 3D face recognition, and 3D animation.
        In this tutorial, we will mainly focus on point cloud reconstruction and segmentation.
        <br>
        <br>

        Existing 3D point cloud segmentation methods can be broadly divided into two categories based on the
        segmentation granularity, <I>i.e.</I>, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation methods.
        Due to the unique properties (<I>i.e.</I>, unstructured, irregular, and orderless) of 3D point clouds,
        it is still highly challenging to achieve fast and robust segmentation of 3D point clouds.
        Recently, a large number of 3D point cloud segmentation algorithms have been proposed in literature.
        The proposed tutorial will therefore present a comprehensive review and analysis of the state-of-the-art 3D
        segmentation algorithms. The tutorial will also provide extensive performance evaluation results of the
        state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets, along with insightful discussions and analyses.
        Moreover, a number of interesting 3D related applications will be introduced in the tutorial.
        Finally, several directions for future work will be discussed.

        <br>
        <br>

        The main objective of the tutorial is to stimulate <I>communication between researchers</I> from different
        areas (including computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning) and from different sectors
        (<I>e.g.</I>, academia and industry). Particularly, this tutorial will bridge the gap between different
        communities by presenting most existing 3D point cloud reconstruction and segmentation pipelines
        in a unified framework.
